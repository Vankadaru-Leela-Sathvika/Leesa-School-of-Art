				<h4>OIL PASTELS</h4>
				<div class="col-md-10 tech_para">
					<p class="para">Oil pastels are made up of a pigment that is held together by linseed oil. Oil Pastels have an oily consistency that produces a painterly effect. The nature of oil pastels allows the artist to work them in a similar way to painting. Thus, a finished oil pastel drawing has many of the characteristics of a finished painting.Oil pastel (also called wax oil crayon) is a painting and drawing medium with characteristics similar to pastels and wax crayons. Unlike "soft" or "Japanese" pastel sticks, which are made with a gum or methyl cellulose binder, oil pastels consist of pigment mixed with a non-drying oil and wax binder.</p>

When the colors go down on the paper they can be a joy of behold. One can say Water Color Painting is a toughest painting, but in our point of view, it is an easy medium, when practiced with involvement and techniques, and that's why we are giving much preference to water color among students. In our Water Color Workshop, we are providing step by step lessons with lot of tips and techniques, which make them becoming national level artists. Students, who are 10 years old may join in this Water Color Painting Course with moderate fees structure We hope, beginners will get proper guidance and training, away from the mire and muddy path.</p>

				<h4>ACRYLIC PAINTING</h4>
				<div class="col-md-10 tech_para">
					<p class="para">Painting is one of the most rewarding ways to artistically express yourself by learning that is a smart decision because the medium is flexible and durable. Using acrylic paint is considerably more affordable than working with oils. What is an acrylic paint? The answer is a water-soluble medium made from a synthetic resin binder mixed with pigments. The water soluble aspect of acrylic paints means that a painting dries quickly and you do not have to use solvents to dilute the paint or for cleaning brushes or a palette. But after an acrylic painting on canvas dries the surface becomes water resistant, and a canvas can be rolled up and stored with no fear of cracking or damaging. This is all in contrast to oil paints, which need to be thinned with solvents, take much longer to dry and harden as they do so, making them quite fragile and not so easily transported. Acrylic painting, for beginners, can be an exciting prospect because acrylics have so much versatility. Mediums can be added to the paints to increase luminosity or to get a matte or semi-matte finish. Acrylic pigments can also be diluted with water or a medium to create watercolorlike transparent washes. You can add mediums that thicken acrylic paint as well, which is ideal if you want more noticeable brushstrokes as you put acrylic paint on canvas.</p>
